This is the repo to hold the web client for viewing flares.

On production, that's hosted on flares.getemit.com.

No design docs here; you'll know where to find those if you're supposed to.

Oh and also, if you're using VS Code (I hope you are, haha!), take a look at the recommended extensions in the `.vscode` folder.
